== Introduction

AddressBook Level 4 (AB4) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. More importantly, AB4 is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB4 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the address book +
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal`

=== Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the address book. +
Format: `list`

=== Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the address book. +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

=== Locating persons by any field: `find`

Finds persons whose fields contain any of the given keywords. +
User can search with or without prefix.
When search without prefix, any person whose fields contain any keywords will be returned.
When search with prefix, person who contains all keywords in his or her correspoding fields will be returned.

Format1: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Format2: `find prefix/KEYWORD, [MORE KEYWORDS] prefix/KEYWORD ...`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* If there is no prefix, all fields will be searched
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
****


These are 3 search pattern that user can search with `find` command: +

1. Exact keyword match - Matches the input keyword with exact keywords found in the fields of persons. +

2. Fuzzy keyword match - Matches the input keyword to fields of persons with a similarity comparison. Here Levenshtein distance is used to calculate the edit distance between two strings. Subsequently, similarity = 1 - Levenshtein_Distance/Max_Length_Of_Two_String. The similarity threshold is set to 0.5. If a person's fields containing keyword which have more than 0.5 similarity comparing to the input keywords, he or she will be returned as fuzzy search result. +

3. Wildcard keyword match – Matches your search keyword with wildcard character '*'. * represents any number of characters.

Search results are displayed in the following format +

n persons listed:
 Exact Search:
 [NAME]
 Fuzzy Search:
 [NAME]
Wildcard Search:
 [NAME]


Examples:

* `find John` +
Returns any person having fields contain keyword `John`
* `find PGP Utown` +
Returns any person having fields contain keywords `PGP` or `Utown`
* `find t/friends teammate` +
Returns any person having tag contains keywords `friends` OR tag `teammate`
* `find n/Betsy t/friends` +
Returns the person having name contains keyword `Betsy` AND tag contains keyword `friends`

****

The fuzzy search algorithm is implemented to cater to users that fit the following profiles: +
1. Unsure what they want to search for +
2. Aware of some patterns of the keywords but not the full keyword +
3. Prone to typos +

If you are certain that you want to find a certain keyword, please use the wildcard `"example"` so that all fields that contains the search keyword would be displayed only. Customizing fuzzy searching is one of our considerations for `v2.0`.

Examples: +

[TIP]
General tips are not repeated across different examples!

* `find bernice, charlot` +
Returns list of persons whose keywords in **any** of their fields are of an exact keyword match **OR** fuzzy keyword match with `bernice` **OR** `charlot`. In the sample data provided, the list will return persons `Bernice Yu` and `Charlotte Oliveiro`. Keyword `bernice` is an exact keyword match with one of the keywords `Bernice` and `charlot` is a fuzzy keyword match with one of the keywords `Charlotte` in `Charlotte Oliveiro`.

[TIP]
The search is case insensitive in HR+. e.g `bernice` might match `Bernice`. +
Different keywords should be **comma separated**, if not it will be treated as one keyword in HR+. +
All fields are searched if no prefix is supplied **first** in HR+. If the first keyword does not **start** with a valid prefix, this command would assume a global search for **all** fields. A global search does an **OR** search between keywords. +
Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned in HR+. +

* `find e/alexyeoh@example.com, lidavxx@example.com j/Software p/87438807` +
Returns list of persons that matches the following conditions: +
1. Keywords in their `email` field are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with `alexyeoh@example.com` **OR** `lidavxx@example.com` **AND** +
2. Keywords in their `job applied` field are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with `Software` **AND** +
3. Keywords in their `phone` field are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with `87438807`. +
In the sample data provided, the list will return person `Alex` as he is the only person that matches all these conditions.

[TIP]
The first keyword is prepended with a prefix, thus this command assumes a prefix search. A prefix search does an **OR** search between keywords in the same prefix and an **AND** search between different prefixes. +

* `find Mohammed, Julius, n/test@example.com` +
Returns list of persons whose keywords in **any** of their fields that are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with `Mohammed`, `Julius` **OR** `n/test@example.com`. In the sample data provided, the list will return persons `Julius Hassange` and `Mohammed Lee`. +

[TIP]
The prefix is not accounted for in the third keyword as the first keyword does not **start** with a valid prefix.

* `find alex bernice david` +
Returns list of persons whose keywords in **any** of their fields that are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with `alex bernice david`. In the sample data provided, this command will return an empty list.

* `find n/alex bernice david p/98293213 92421423` +
Returns list of persons that matches the following conditions: +
1. Keywords in their `name` field are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with keyword `alex bernice david` **AND** +
2. Keywords in their `phone` field are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with keyword `98293213 92421423` +
In the sample data provided, this command will return an empty list. +

[TIP]
Keywords are not comma separated, thus they are treated as one keyword.

* `find bernice, "alex", ir&ast;, &ast;li` +
Returns list of persons with **any** of their fields that matches the following conditions: +
1. Keywords that are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with keyword `bernice` **OR**
2. Field contains keyword `alex` **OR**
3. Field starts with keyword `ir` **OR**
4. Field ends with keyword `li` +
In the sample data provided, this command will return persons `Alex Yeoh`, `Bernice Yu`, `David Li` and `Irfan Ibrahim`. +

* `find n/bernice, "alex", ir&ast;, &ast;li e/&ast;example.com p/"5" m/Computer&ast;` +
Returns list of persons with matches the following conditions: +
1. `Name` field with keywords that are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with keyword `bernice` **OR** contains keyword `alex` **OR** starts with `ir` **OR** ends with `li` **AND** +
2. `Email` field ends with keyword `example.com` **AND** +
3. `Phone` field contains keyword `5` **AND** +
4. `Major` field starts with keyword `Computer` +
In the sample data provided, the list with return person `Bernice` as she is the only person that matches all these conditions.


* `find berni, charlot, bernice, charlotte` +
Returns list of persons whose keywords in **any** of their fields that are of an exact match **OR** fuzzy match with `berni` **OR** `charlot` **OR** `bernice` **OR** `charlotte`. In the sample data provided, the list will return persons `Bernice Yu` and `Charlotte Oliveiro`. +

Below shows how the application console looks like when this command is executed:

****
Exact word search matches: +
charlotte: - +
charlot: - +
bernice: - +
berni: - +

Fuzzy search matches: +
charlotte: - +
charlot: (n/)Charlotte +
bernice: - +
berni: (n/)Bernice +

Wildcard search matches: +
****

[TIP]
When a search keyword matches a person first, subsequent search keywords that matches the same person would be reflected in the application console as `-`.
