== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: upgrade *find command and implement *findE to support different search patterns in searching contact list and event list*
** What it does: The `find` command allows the user to search for a person in contact list easily. User can search a person through exact keyword match, fuzzy keyword match or wildcard keyword match.
The `findE` command allows the user to search for a event in contact list. User can search a event through exact keyword match, search the event on today, tomorrow and yesterday, and search the event with a certain duration.
** Justification: This feature is significant and efficient for user to manage a large list of contacts and events.
** Highlights: The enhancement and implementation involves reorganizing parse class and adding new predicates and several other class. The implementation is challenging because different search pattern is used and optimal algorithm is chosen after detailed analysis of the alternatives.
** Credits: levenshtein distance is used to calculate similaity between keywords. https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kirk/cs1501/Pruhs/Spring2006/assignments/editdistance/Levenshtein%20Distance.htm

* *Minor enhancement*:
**Implement *photo command which allows user to add photo to the person in the contact list.
**Implement personInfo fxml to display personal information on contact list.
